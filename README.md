This app developed in Python is intended to be used by teachers who want to carry out activities in their classroom in a similar way to Kahoot. The teacher creates a bank of activities where each activity consists of one or more questions in multiple choice format. The teacher selects the activity and the problems in the activity.
The teacher then enables the application and students submit their answers via their cell phones or tablets. At the end of the activity time, students get an immediate response and the scores along with the student's name are saved in a pdf document.
This app might be mounted either in Raspberry along with Ngnix and Gunicorn or displayed in a more robust  Ngnix server.
